**MSc Economics @ AUEB** • **Open to DA/DS/ML Internships in Athens**

Hi! I’m Hayk, a Master’s student in Economics at the Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB).  
I enjoy probability and stats, machine learning and applied econometrics. I’m currently writing my dissertation on **comparing MCMC methods for a stochastic volatility model**, focusing on runtime, stability, and inference quality. 

- 📍 Based in **Athens, Greece**; open to **part-time / internship** data related roles (data analysis, data science, machine learning engineering).
- 🧠 Strong foundations in **probability**, **econometrics**, and **Bayesian methods**; hands-on **Python / SQL / R**.

## What I’m working on
- **SV + Bayesian MCMC (Dissertation, Python).**  
  Comparing multiple MCMC approaches for stochastic volatility (ESS/s, acceptance, diagnostics).  
  _Repo_: <https://github.com/hayk9704/MCMC-StochVol> (WIP)

- **Mastering Data Wrangling (Python, SQL).**  
  End-to-end data cleaning, feature engineering, tidy transforms, and reproducible pipelines.  
  _Repo_: <https://github.com/hayk9704/<data-wrangling-repo>>
