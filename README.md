**MSc Economics @ AUEB** • **Bayesian MCMC & Stochastic Volatility** • **Open to Data/DS Internships in Athens**

Hi! I’m Hayk, a Master’s student in Economics at the Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB).  
I’m currently writing my dissertation on **comparing MCMC methods for a stochastic volatility model** (Python), focusing on runtime, stability, and inference quality. I enjoy applied econometrics, time series, and building clean, reproducible data workflows.

- 📍 Based in **Athens, Greece**; open to **part-time / internship** roles.
- 🧠 Strong foundations in **probability**, **econometrics**, and **Bayesian methods**; hands-on **Python / SQL / R**.

## What I’m working on
- **SV + Bayesian MCMC (Dissertation, Python).**  
  Comparing multiple MCMC approaches for stochastic volatility (ESS/s, acceptance, diagnostics).  
  _Repo_: <https://github.com/hayk9704/SV-MCMC> (WIP)

- **Mastering Data Wrangling (Python).**  
  End-to-end data cleaning, feature engineering, tidy transforms, and reproducible pipelines.
